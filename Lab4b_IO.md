Write a function that takes the same text file as input as in Lab 4a and finds the value that is reached twice first during the summarization of the values.

The function should then stop incrementing the sum, and output the value that was reached twice first.

### Example:

+10 # Starts with 10  
-2 # Reduced to 8  
+3 # Incremented to 11  
-5 # Reduced to 6  
+2 # Incremented to 8 again

**8 is the first number reached twice.**
